# MVP Plan — CloudFreedom Agent Platform

Constraints (current host):

- Coolify server: **12 cores**, **31 GB RAM**, **2 TB disk**, ~**24 GB free**
- Docker + Traefik already in use for CloudFreedom Router tenants

## MVP goal (4–6 weeks)

Enable CloudFreedom to sell and operate **tenant-scoped agent hosting** with 2–3 templates, integrated into existing tenant management.

Deliverables:

- Provisioner CLI (Coolify API)
- 3 production-ready templates
- Admin workflow (manual button/ops runbook is acceptable for MVP)
- Security guardrails (limits, secrets, isolation) and basic incident playbooks

## What we ship in MVP

### Templates

1. **Telegram bot template**
   - minimal bot that can call CloudFreedom Router
   - health check + logs
2. **OpenClaw agent template**
   - long-running worker / agent runtime
   - supports webhook triggers + scheduled tasks
3. **Base LLM tenant template**
   - LiteLLM as gateway (optional)
   - OpenWebUI for tenant UI

### Provisioning

- Create project per tenant.
- Deploy compose stack as Coolify service (`POST /api/v1/services`).
- Store metadata back to PocketBase (in MVP this can be a manual step; next iteration makes it automatic).

### Ops

- Standard resource limits per plan.
- Standard naming/labels.
- Backup policy for volumes (daily for paid plans).

## Resource budgeting (realistic)

Given only ~24 GB free disk today, MVP must be conservative:

- Prefer stateless agents where possible.
- For stateful stacks (OpenWebUI), limit number of tenants.

Suggested per-stack limits:

- **Telegram bot / small agent**: 0.25–0.5 CPU, 256–512 MB RAM, no volume
- **OpenClaw agent**: 0.5–1 CPU, 512 MB–1 GB RAM, small volume for state (<=1–2 GB)
- **OpenWebUI + LiteLLM**: 2 CPU, 3–6 GB RAM, volumes for UI state (>=5 GB)

## Plan gating (MVP)

- Starter: 1–2 stacks, small limits
- Team: up to 10 stacks, larger limits
- Business: 25+ stacks, priority support, larger quotas
- Sovereign: custom, dedicated resources, optional dedicated host

## MVP milestones

### Week 1

- Finalize templates and security defaults
- Provisioner MVP: create project + deploy service

### Week 2

- Add template rendering + env injection
- Add idempotency: reuse project if exists
- Add dry-run + structured logs

### Week 3

- Integrate with PocketBase data model (read tenant, store `coolify_*_uuid`)
- Add basic operator runbook

### Week 4–6

- Add admin portal UI actions (Provision / Suspend / Delete)
- Add alerting (container unhealthy, OOM)
- Expand template catalog based on demand

## Acceptance criteria

- A new tenant can be provisioned (project + stack) in < 5 minutes.
- Containers run with resource limits and non-root where possible.
- Only required ports are exposed; TLS via Traefik.
- Tenant metadata is persisted (PocketBase) and can be audited.
